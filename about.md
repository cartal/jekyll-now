I'm a Nicaraguan computational biologist in Sarah Teichmann's [group](http://www.teichlab.org/) at the 
Wellcome Sanger Institute. I'm very interested in applying methods from the artificial intelligence field 
to multiomics datasets.

### The scientific journey

**EMBL-EBI and Wellcome Sanger Institute** / Postdoctoral fellow  
_September  2018 - Present,  Cambridge, UK._

Working in Sarah Teichmann’s lab with large scale, multi-omics single cell datasets and artificial intelligence methods, and being [opinionated](https://www.cell.com/trends/immunology/fulltext/S1471-4906(19)30192-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1471490619301929%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) about it. My research interests include the transcriptional regulation of the adult human heart, myeloid immune cells and their interaction during heart injury repair.  I also collaborated in the deployment of _state-of-the-art_ single cell analysis tools for the Human Cell Atlas [web portal](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/D1/D77/5609521) at EMBL-EBI.  

**The Francis Crick Institute** / Postdoctoral fellow  
_September  2016 - September 2018,  London, UK._

I worked in the Malaria immunology laboratory using machine learning methods applied to RNA-Seq and proteomic data, as well as publicly available datasets, to study the immunological processes involved during malaria infection in a mouse model with [_Plasmodium chabaudi_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52388-y). 

**London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine** / Visiting researcher  
_June 2015 - September 2016,  London, UK._

I worked with Michael Miles at the LSHTM on genome analysis of _Leishmania Spp._ and _Trypanosoma cruzi_ hybrids. I also worked in the development of diagnostic tools for _Strongyloides spp._ using proteomic and genomic public datasets.  

**Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet** / Ph.D student  
_March 2012 - September 2016,  Stockholm, Sweden._

I studied genomic variation in clinical and field isolates of [_Trypanosoma cruzi_]((https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/283531v2)) with Bjӧrn Andersson. I also worked in the development of analysis pipelines for single cell RNA-Seq of immune cells with statistical learning methods with Jonas Frisén. I also assembled and annotated the [_Pleurodeles waltl_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01964-9) genome, used as a model for regeneration with András Simon. Besides the computational work, I also gained experience with DNA and RNA NGS library preparation. 

**Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab)** / Bioinformatician  
_January 2011 -  March 2012,  Stockholm, Sweden._

I worked as a bioinformatician for the [Spruce Genome Consortium](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12211) testing and developing assembly methods for large genomes and comparative genomics of conifers.  During this period I gained experience on programming languages and high-throughput computational tools.
