I'm a Nicaraguan computational biologist in Sarah Teichmann's [group](http://www.teichlab.org/) at the 
Wellcome Sanger Institute. I'm very interested in the studying the inflammatory response and tissue repair 
applying methods from the artificial intelligence field to multiomics datasets.

When I'm not working, you can find me reading, playing with my synthesisers or watching my girlfriend slaying monsters while she plays The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.

## The scientific journey

**Institute of Computational Biology - Helmholtz Zentrum München** / Team leader
_June 2021 - Onwards, Munich Germany_

In June 2021 I will start working as a team leader at ICB focusing the study of infectious diseases using spatially-resolved single cell technologies and machine learning. 

**EMBL-EBI and Wellcome Sanger Institute** / Postdoctoral fellow  
_September  2018 - June 2021,  Cambridge, United Kingdom._

Working in Sarah Teichmann’s lab with large scale, multi-omics single cell datasets and artificial intelligence methods, and being [opinionated](https://www.cell.com/trends/immunology/fulltext/S1471-4906(19)30192-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1471490619301929%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) about it. My research interests include the transcriptional regulation of the adult human heart, myeloid immune cells and their interaction during heart injury repair.  I also collaborated in the deployment of _state-of-the-art_ single cell analysis tools for the Human Cell Atlas [web portal](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/D1/D77/5609521) at EMBL-EBI.

On September 2020 we published the single cell atlas of the human heart in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2797-4).   

**The Francis Crick Institute** / Postdoctoral fellow  
_September  2016 - September 2018,  London, United Kingdom._

I worked in the Malaria immunology laboratory using machine learning methods applied to RNA-Seq and proteomic data, as well as publicly available datasets, to study the immunological processes involved during malaria infection in a mouse model with [_Plasmodium chabaudi_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52388-y). 

**London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine** / Visiting researcher  
_June 2015 - September 2016,  London, United Kingdom._

I worked with Michael Miles at the LSHTM on genome analysis of _Leishmania Spp._ and _Trypanosoma cruzi_ hybrids. I also worked in the development of diagnostic tools for _Strongyloides spp._ using proteomic and genomic public datasets.  

**Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet** / Ph.D student  
_March 2012 - September 2016,  Stockholm, Sweden._

I studied genomic variation in clinical and field isolates of [_Trypanosoma cruzi_]((https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/283531v2)) with Bjӧrn Andersson. I also worked in the development of analysis pipelines for single cell RNA-Seq of immune cells with statistical learning methods with Jonas Frisén. I also assembled and annotated the [_Pleurodeles waltl_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01964-9) genome, used as a model for regeneration with András Simon. Besides the computational work, I also gained experience with DNA and RNA NGS library preparation. 

**Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab)** / Bioinformatician  
_January 2011 -  March 2012,  Stockholm, Sweden._

I worked as a bioinformatician for the [Spruce Genome Consortium](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12211) testing and developing assembly methods for large genomes and comparative genomics of conifers.  During this period I gained experience on programming languages and high-throughput computational tools.
